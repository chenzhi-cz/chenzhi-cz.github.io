Hi, I'm Zhi Chen (陈智). I'm from [Putian City](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8E%86%E7%94%B0%E5%B8%82), Fujian Province, China. I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Centre for Research on Intelligent Software Engineering](https://rise.smu.edu.sg/) at Singapore Management University (SMU), supervised by [Professor Jiang Lingxiao](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/jiang-lingxiao-896). My research focuses on evaluating and developing strategies to enhance AI-driven software development. I also have two years of experience as a software engineer in Singapore and Shanghai. I am always open to collaborating with researchers from both academia and industry. Feel free to reach out if you have exciting projects in mind!
