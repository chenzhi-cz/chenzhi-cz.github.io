Hi, I'm Chen Zhi (陈智) from [Putian City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putian), Fujian Province, China. I'm currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [Centre for Research on Intelligent Software Engineering](https://rise.smu.edu.sg/), Singapore Management University (SMU). My research focuses on evaluating and developing strategies to enhance AI-driven software development. I also have two years of experience as a software engineer in Shanghai and Singapore. I am always open to collaborating with researchers from both academia and industry. Feel free to reach out if you have exciting projects in mind!
